- 👋 Hi, I’m @lee-oconnor
- My birthname is Sherri, but my nickname is Lee. Sorry for confusion.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything FrontEnd! I come from a background in photography, where I spent most of my career shooting people and things for advertising and editorial clients.
- I decided to pivot into a different career path last year, and chose tech because I've long been curious about how the devices we use everyday work behind the scenes! 
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the advanced React course through Scrimba 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any apps that help people in their everyday lives!
- 📫 How to reach me: lee.oconnor.dev@gmail.com
